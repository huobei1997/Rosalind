# Rosalind Algorithm Solutions

This project aims to solve algorithm problems from Rosalind using Python.

## Introduction

[Rosalind](http://rosalind.info/) is a platform designed to teach computer science and mathematics through bioinformatics problems. In this project, I will be writing Python code to solve these problems.

## Project Structure

- `Scripts/` - Contains solutions for each Rosalind problem.
- `Data/` - Stores input data.
- `Results/` - Stores output results.

## Installation

Make sure you have Python 3.13.2 installed. You can download and install it from the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/).
